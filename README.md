# Python_Base_Convert
Python Arbitrary base converter
Very simplistic python 3 arbitrary base converter. Takes a number in an arbitrary base and converts it to another arbitrary base. Current limitation up to base 16. Limited only by character set.

To Do:
  -Incorporate large base values, possibly with ASCII table, to at least BASE64.
  -Error handelling
  -Input cleanup, formating
